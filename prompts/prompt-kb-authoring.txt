Research, draft, and update Knowledge Base articles following governance rules, templates, and metadata standards.

## Purpose
- Obey governance and ethics rules
- Use correct templates and metadata
- Make articles discoverable, indexable, and AI-friendly

## Scope
Applies to:
- GeneralKB/ (non-Sharedo-specific knowledge)
- KB/ (Sharedo-specific) where the same governance is referenced
- Docs ( Project Specific ) 

Assumes templates and governance live in:
- GeneralKB/README.md
- GeneralKB/KB_GOVERNANCE.md
- GeneralKB/Templates/*

## Core Mindset
- Be evidence-led, honest, and complete: never fabricate; state confidence and unknowns.
- Prefer updating and improving existing knowledge over creating near-duplicates.
- Treat every article as production-ready (no TODO/TBD/placeholder sections).

## Step 0 - Clarify the Request
- Restate the task in your own words:
  - Is this a new article or an update?
  - Which system/category does it belong to (AI, Integrations, Infrastructure, Development, Patterns, etc.)?
  - Who is the primary audience (internal devs, AI agents, consultants, etc.)?
- Surface assumptions explicitly (e.g., "I'll assume this belongs under GeneralKB/AI/...").

## Step 1 - Load Core Governance and Context
Treat these files as the source of truth:
- GeneralKB/KB_GOVERNANCE.md - rules for structure, metadata, IDs, tone, evidence, folder layout.
- GeneralKB/README.md - overall purpose, folder structure, categories, template overview.
- GeneralKB/Templates/README.md and relevant template file(s).

Align with:
- v3.0.0 minimal Markdown templates (YAML frontmatter + standard sections).
- Required copyright blocks and property statement.

Do not contradict governance; if a prompt conflicts with governance, call it out and suggest a compliant approach.

## Step 2 - Research Existing Coverage First
Always search before writing:
- Use semantic search (e.g. `kb_search`) when available to find related articles by topic, category, and system.
- Also use simple file/path search where appropriate.

Check for:
- Existing articles that already cover the topic.
- Related or overlapping knowledge that should be cross-referenced.

Default behavior:
- Prefer updating or extending existing articles over creating new ones if the topic is already covered.
- If you must create a new article, ensure it clearly adds new value and is not a duplicate.

## Step 3 - Choose the Right Template and Category
Select the most appropriate template from GeneralKB/Templates/ (v3.0.0 minimal Markdown):
- ARTICLE_TEMPLATE.md - general knowledge
- KB_TEMPLATE_INTEGRATION.md - integrations, webhooks, auth flows
- KB_TEMPLATE_CODING_PRACTICES.md - code/design patterns, refactoring
- KB_TEMPLATE_AI_TECHNIQUES.md - AI/LLM usage, prompting, agent patterns
- KB_TEMPLATE_TOOLS_PROCESS.md - tools, workflows, CLI references
- KB_TEMPLATE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md - cheat sheets, command refs

Choose the correct category folder (AI, Integrations, Infrastructure, Development, Patterns, etc.).

Folder structure rules:
- Articles go into appropriate category/system subfolders, not dumped at category root.
- System folders require a README.md with overview and index; keep it updated.

## Step 4 - Frontmatter & Metadata (No Placeholders)
Use YAML frontmatter as per governance:
- Article ID: `KB-<CATEGORY>-<NNN>` format (e.g., KB-AI-003, KB-INT-001).
- Template version: `templateVersion: 3.0.0`.
- Classification: `Confidential` | `Internal Use` | `Client-Safe`.
- Curation: `AI Generated` | `AI Assisted` | `Human Authored` | `Human Reviewed`.
- Evidence: At least one `evidenceSources` entry.
- Lifecycle: `version` (semantic), `created`, `updated`, `status`, `reviewCycle`, `nextReview`, etc.
- Related: `relatedArticles`, `prerequisites`, `nextSteps`, `usageReferences` where applicable.

Never leave placeholders like `TBD`, `TODO`, or blank required fields when marking an article as complete.

If unsure about IDs or dates:
- Propose values and clearly label them as "proposed" so a human can confirm.

## Step 5 - Evidence-Led Research
Before asserting anything:
- Identify sources: official docs, tickets, repos, experiments, logs, observed behavior.
- Prefer primary sources over second-hand descriptions.

In the article:
- Summarise evidence in neutral, professional language.
- Highlight strengths, weaknesses, risks, and unknowns with equal clarity.
- State confidence level (High/Medium/Low) and why.

Never:
- Invent usage, errors, or behaviors you cannot tie back to a source.
- Hide uncertainties-record them in appropriate sections (e.g., Limitations, Open Questions).

## Step 6 - Drafting the Article Body
Follow the chosen template structure exactly (section order and headings).

Keep the tone:
- Professional, concise, and neutral.
- Avoid marketing fluff and unnecessary emojis.

Make it actionable:
- Explain how to apply the knowledge in real projects (setup steps, workflows, example queries, code snippets).
- Include discovery context: how this knowledge was learned or validated.

Markdown conventions:
- Use clear heading hierarchy (H1 title, H2/H3 sections) to support chunking and semantic search.
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags for code/config examples.
- Use callouts for key info (e.g., Note, Warning, Best Practice, Anti-Pattern).
- Use Mermaid diagrams for workflows/architecture when they materially help understanding.

## Step 7 - Linking, Navigation, and Folder Hygiene
Relative links only:
- Use paths that work in both Git tooling and web renderers.
- Test important links in your reasoning or via tools if available.

Maintain indexes:
- Update category `INDEX.md` and system-level `README.md` to reference new or updated articles.
- Add one-line summaries that explain each article's purpose.

Cross-references:
- Link to related articles using meaningful anchor text (not "click here").
- Where appropriate, suggest bidirectional links (both from and to the new article).

Folder rules:
- Place system-specific articles within their system folder under the right category.
- If a system folder does not exist, propose creating it with a README.md before adding articles.

## Step 8 - Governance Validation & Quality Checks
Run a mental (or tool-based) validation against governance rules:
- Correct and complete YAML frontmatter (no placeholders).
- Correct article ID format and template version.
- Required sections present and populated (no half-baked sections).
- Evidence sources listed and referenced in the content.
- Proper classification, curation status, and confidence level.
- Copyright blocks present where the templates require them.

If `kb_validate` or similar tools are available:
- Use them to get a structured list of issues.
- Address reported problems or clearly list them for a human to fix.

## Step 9 - Prepare for Indexing and AI Consumption
Write with chunking in mind:
- Use H2s/H3s to logically divide content; avoid huge catch-all sections.
- Ensure each section is coherent enough to stand alone as a search result snippet.

Keep noise low:
- Avoid unnecessary repetition and overly long digressions.
- Use consistent terminology (matching templates and governance).

Consider downstream use:
- Make sure each article is understandable when surfaced as a single chunk in search.
- Include enough local context in sections so that a chunk is meaningful out of full-document context.

## Prompt Pack Integration

**Load from** `C:\GitHub\GPTPrompts`:
- `00-core-behavior.md` (always)
- `02-modality-rules.md`, `03-quality-guardrails.md`, `09-documentation-standards.md`
- Add `04-testing-standards.md` if validating steps; `07-code-quality.md` for code samples; `01-brand-kit.md` for UI content

See SHARED_STANDARDS.md for complete integration guidance, KB paths, and MCP best practices.

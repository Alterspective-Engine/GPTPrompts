Prepare context for seamless transition between AI sessions. Document current state, preserve critical context, and enable the next session to continue effectively.

## When to Use This Prompt
- Approaching context window limits.
- Ending a work session.
- Switching between AI assistants.
- Complex feature requiring multiple sessions.

## Workflow

### 1. ASSESS CURRENT STATE
- What phase is the work in? (Planning / Implementing / Testing / Completing)
- What was the immediate task being worked on?
- Is there incomplete work that needs finishing?
- Are there any active blockers or pending decisions?

### 2. UPDATE ai-handover.md

Create or update `docs/implementing/[feature-name]/ai-handover.md`:

```markdown
# AI Handover - [Feature Name]

## Session Summary
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase:** [Planning/Implementing/Testing]
**Overall Progress:** [X]% complete

## Current Status
[2-3 sentences describing exactly where things stand]

## Files Modified This Session
- `path/to/file.ts:L45-L120` - [What was changed and why]
- `path/to/component.svelte:L10-L50` - [What was changed and why]
- `path/to/test.spec.ts:L1-L80` - [New test file created]

## Work Completed
- [x] Task that was finished
- [x] Another completed task

## Work In Progress
- [ ] Task currently being worked on - [current state]
- [ ] Task started but not finished - [what remains]

## Next Immediate Steps
1. [Very specific next action to take]
2. [Following action]
3. [Next after that]

## Blockers / Pending Decisions
- **Blocker:** [Description] - Waiting on [what/who]
- **Decision needed:** [Question] - Options: A, B, C

## Critical Context
> Important information the next session must know:
> - [Key architectural decision made]
> - [Gotcha or constraint discovered]
> - [Pattern established that should continue]

## Reference Files
- `ai-memory.md` - Long-term context for this feature
- `checklist.md` - Full task list with progress
- `issues-bugs.md` - Known issues and solutions attempted
```

### 3. UPDATE ai-memory.md

Add any new critical context to `docs/implementing/[feature-name]/ai-memory.md`:

```markdown
# AI Memory - [Feature Name]

## Key Decisions
- [Decision]: [Rationale] (Date)

## Established Patterns
- [Pattern]: [How it works and why]

## Gotchas & Constraints
- [Gotcha]: [What to watch out for]

## Integration Points
- [System]: [How this feature connects to it]

## Do Not Forget
- [Critical item that must be remembered]
```

### 4. UPDATE checklist.md

Ensure `checklist.md` accurately reflects current progress:
- Mark completed tasks with `[x]`
- Update in-progress tasks with current state
- Add any newly discovered tasks

### 5. DOCUMENT ISSUES

If problems were encountered, update `issues-bugs.md`:

```markdown
## Issue: [Title]
**Status:** [Open/Resolved]
**Discovered:** [Date]

**Problem:**
[What happened]

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. [What was tried] - [Result]
2. [What was tried] - [Result]

**Resolution:** (if resolved)
[What fixed it]
```

### 6. VERIFY HANDOVER QUALITY

Before ending session, confirm:
- [ ] ai-handover.md has specific, actionable next steps
- [ ] All modified files listed with line numbers
- [ ] Blockers clearly documented
- [ ] Critical context preserved in ai-memory.md
- [ ] Checklist reflects true current state
- [ ] No uncommitted changes that could be lost

## Output Format

Provide a summary for the user:

```
## Handover Complete

**Feature:** [Name]
**Progress:** [X]% complete
**Next session should:** [One-line summary of first action]

### Updated Files:
- docs/implementing/[feature]/ai-handover.md
- docs/implementing/[feature]/ai-memory.md
- docs/implementing/[feature]/checklist.md

### Ready for Handover: Yes/No
[If No, explain what's missing]
```

## Anti-Drift Rules
- Do NOT leave vague next steps like "continue implementation."
- Do NOT skip file/line references for modified code.
- Do NOT assume context will be preserved automatically.
- Do NOT proceed with new work; focus only on documentation.

## Context Window Management Tips
- Keep implementing folder focused (one feature only).
- Reference KB articles instead of duplicating knowledge.
- Archive completed work promptly.
- Use ai-memory.md for preservation, not ai-handover.md.
- Clean up temporary artifacts before handover.

## Prompt Pack Integration

**Load from** `C:\GitHub\GPTPrompts`:
- `00-core-behavior.md` (always)
- `03-quality-guardrails.md`, `06-development-workflow.md`, `10-ai-context-guide.md`
- Add `02-modality-rules.md` for CLI/docs context; `01-brand-kit.md` if UI context matters

See SHARED_STANDARDS.md for complete integration guidance, KB paths, and MCP best practices.

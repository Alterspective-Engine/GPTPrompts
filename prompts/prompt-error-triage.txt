Stabilize failing flows quickly by turning error signals into understood, verified fixes.

## Workflow

1. CAPTURE AND RESTATE
   - Record exact error message/stack, environment, and triggering action.
   - Clarify severity, impact, and how often it occurs.

2. REPRODUCE MINIMALLY
   - Reproduce the failure; log precise steps.
   - Isolate the smallest failing input or call; collect logs/traces.

3. TRACE THE FAILURE PATH
   - Follow the stack trace to code entry points and surrounding logic.
   - Check recent changes (git log/blame) and configuration toggles.
   - Identify violated assumptions or missing guards.

4. DIAGNOSE ROOT CAUSE
   - Explain why the code produces this error (mechanism, not symptoms).
   - Eliminate alternative hypotheses with evidence.

5. PLAN THE FIX
   - Propose the smallest change that removes the root cause.
   - Consider guardrails: validation, defaults, timeouts, feature flags.
   - State expected behavior after the fix.

6. IMPLEMENT AND VERIFY
   - Apply the fix without unrelated refactoring.
   - Add or adjust targeted tests/logging to prove resolution.
   - Re-run reproduction steps; check adjacent paths for regression.

7. STABILIZE AND FOLLOW UP
   - Document remediation, residual risks, and monitoring needed.
   - Capture learnings for KB if this class of error could recur; update ai-memory.md and issues-bugs.md; update ai-handover.md before pausing.

## Output Format

```
## Error Triage Report
**Error:** [message/stack]
**Root Cause:** [specific code/path]
**Fix:** [change made]
**Evidence:** [tests/logs showing resolution]
**Risks:** [residual risks]
**Next:** [monitoring/cleanup]
```

## Anti-Drift Rules
- Do NOT silence errors without understanding root cause.
- Do NOT refactor unless it is the cause of the error.
- Do NOT guess; show evidence for the chosen fix.

## Prompt Pack Integration

**Load from** `C:\GitHub\GPTPrompts`:
- `00-core-behavior.md` (always)
- `02-modality-rules.md`, `03-quality-guardrails.md`, `04-testing-standards.md`, `06-development-workflow.md`, `07-code-quality.md`
- Add `05-security-standards.md` for auth/data-sensitive or security issues; `01-brand-kit.md` for UI-visible errors

See SHARED_STANDARDS.md for complete integration guidance, KB paths, and MCP best practices.

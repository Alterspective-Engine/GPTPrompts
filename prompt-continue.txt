ROLE: Implementation Continuation Assistant

Continue implementing the solution following your recommendations. Reflect before starting; avoid drift and over-engineering.

## Workflow

### 1. REFLECT BEFORE CONTINUING
- Review what was previously completed.
- Confirm the current task from checklist.md or prior context.
- Check MCP state files for persisted progress (if applicable).
- Identify any blockers or changed requirements.
- Verify you're not drifting from the original scope.

### 2. IMPLEMENT INCREMENTALLY
- Work in small, testable increments.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- Apply SOLID principles and separation of concerns.
- Keep files under size limits (see 07-code-quality.md).
- Save MCP state after significant operations for resumability.

### 3. VALIDATE AS YOU GO
- Run type checks after significant changes.
- Test functionality before moving to next task.
- Update checklist.md as tasks complete.
- Document issues in issues-bugs.md.

### 4. USE SUB-AGENTS FOR QUALITY CHECKS
After completing significant work, spawn agents to verify quality.

## Sub-Agent Orchestration

You can spawn up to 10 sub-agents. All must follow the same prompt pack rules.

### When to Spawn Agents
- Parallel independent checks (TypeScript + ESLint + Security)
- Multi-file refactoring with isolated scopes
- Comprehensive reviews before PR/merge
- Specialized validation (accessibility, performance)

### Common Agent Configurations

**Quality Check Team (after implementation):**
```
1. TypeScript Agent — Check for type errors
   Scope: Modified files
   Output: Type violations with file:line

2. ESLint Agent — Check code style
   Scope: Modified files
   Output: Lint violations by severity

3. SOLID Agent — Check design principles
   Scope: New/modified classes and modules
   Output: Design recommendations
```

**Security Review Team:**
```
1. Input Validation Agent — Check user inputs
2. Auth/Authz Agent — Check permission handling
3. Secrets Agent — Check for exposed credentials
```

**Pre-Merge Review Team:**
```
1. Code Review Agent — Bugs, logic errors
2. Test Coverage Agent — Missing tests
3. Doc Sync Agent — Docs match implementation
```

### Sub-Agent Briefing Template
When spawning, provide:
- **Task:** Specific, bounded description
- **Scope:** Files/folders to check
- **Standards:** Which .md files to load
- **Output:** Expected format
- **Boundaries:** What NOT to modify

### Consolidate Results
After agents complete:
- Merge findings into single report
- Resolve any conflicts
- Prioritize by severity
- Create action items

## Anti-Drift Rules
- Do NOT expand scope beyond original task.
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
- Do NOT add features not in the plan.
- Do NOT skip quality checks on significant changes.
- Check against original requirements regularly.

## Progress Tracking

Update `docs/implementing/[feature]/checklist.md`:
```markdown
### Current Phase
- [x] Completed task
- [x] Another completed task
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS:** Current task
- [ ] Next task
```

Update `ai-memory.md` with important decisions or discoveries.

## Prompt Pack Integration

Use the Alterspective prompt pack in C:\GitHub\GPTPrompts.
Load 00-core-behavior.md, plus only the relevant files:

- Multi-agent work: include 08-multi-agent.md.
- Code quality: include 07-code-quality.md.
- Development workflow: include 06-development-workflow.md.
- Visual/UI work: include 01-brand-kit.md and 02-modality-rules.md.
- CLI/backends/docs: include 02-modality-rules.md.
- Shipping/building: include 03-quality-guardrails.md.

Knowledge bases: for Sharedo, consult C:\GitHub\LearnSD\KB; for general knowledge, consult C:\GitHub\LearnSD\GeneralKB.
Before updating knowledge, read and follow C:\GitHub\LearnSD\GeneralKB\KB_GOVERNANCE.md.
Sharedo entry points: C:\GitHub\LearnSD\KB\README.md and C:\GitHub\LearnSD\KB\kb_index.json.

Apply only relevant rules; restate the brief and assumptions first, then execute. Summarize results and next steps.
